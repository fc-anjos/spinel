# OpenSSL::Buffering -- the IO-shaped surface over #sysread / #syswrite.
#
# Ported from CRuby's openssl/buffering.rb, whose structure this keeps: a read
# buffer filled a block at a time by #sysread, a write buffer flushed by
# #syswrite, and every reader and writer built on those two. Original
# copyright (C) 2001 GOTOU YUUZOU, licensed under the same licence as Ruby.
#
# What is different here is what the subset does not carry, and it is spelled
# out rather than approximated:
#
# * a line separator is a String, not a Regexp, and `$/` is not consulted
# * the `buf` out-parameter of #read / #readpartial is not accepted
# * the Buffer < String subclass is gone. It exists upstream to keep binary
#   encoding across `<<`, and spinel has one internal representation
# * #each is absent; #each_line is the same iterator under the name every
#   caller uses (see the note above it)
#
# Everything present behaves as CRuby's does.
#
# The contract for a class mixing this in: #sysread, #syswrite and #sysclose,
# plus #sysread_nonblock and #syswrite_nonblock for the non-blocking pair, and
# `super()` from its own #initialize. CRuby leaves the sys* primitives
# implicit because its including class is C; here a class that omits one fails
# to compile rather than at the first call, which is the better place to hear
# about it.
